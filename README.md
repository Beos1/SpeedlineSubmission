When moving to a production version of this app I would want to change quite a few things.  The first would be to visually change the icons and map used.  The icons are icons that I personally made to place on the map are not the best looking. I would change them to something that could be more telling of what is going on at the location.  For the map I would want to change it to one that the user can interact with instead of a static image that I currently have implemented.  The number of weather conditions that I have made for the proof of concept is lacking compared to what I would want to have on a fully fleshed out piece.  Increasing the weather conditions that can be shown on the map increased the functionality greatly.

In order to make the app more maintainable the main thing I would want to do is change how the locations are plotted on the map.  Instead of using longitude and latitude I plotted them based on the specific map that I chose to use for this project as such if the map ever needs to be changed the locations would have to be re plotted onto the new map. While the map may not always need to be changed it creates an extra barrier to get over if the decision is made.
